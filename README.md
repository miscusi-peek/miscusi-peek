### 🚀 My Current Obsession: Diving Deep into .NET 9
The next wave of .NET is here, and I'm all in. Here's what I'm currently exploring, building, and writing about in **.NET 9**:

*   🧠 **Built-in AI & ML:** Experimenting with the new `System.Numerics.Tensors` and integrating OSS models directly into my applications for smarter, more efficient solutions.

*   ☁️ **Next-Gen Cloud-Native:** Leveraging **.NET Aspire** to streamline the development and deployment of distributed, resilient cloud applications. I'm focused on building observable and scalable microservices.

*   ⚡ **Peak Performance & AOT:** Pushing the boundaries of speed and efficiency with .NET 9's improved **Ahead-of-Time (AOT)** compilation, reducing startup times and memory footprints for serverless and containerized workloads.

*   🔧 **C# 13 Features:** Mastering the latest language features in C# 13 to write more expressive, concise, and powerful code.

*   🌐 **Modern Web & UI:** Building interactive web experiences with the latest Blazor enhancements and exploring the future of cross-platform UI with .NET MAUI.
